                <p class="question">What is AmazonSmile?</p>

                <p>
                    AmazonSmile is a website operated by Amazon with the same
                    products, prices, and shopping features as Amazon.com. The
                    difference is that when you shop on AmazonSmile, the
                    AmazonSmile Foundation will donate 0.5% of the purchase price
                    of eligible products to the charitable organization of your
                    choice.

                <p class="question">What is Donate and Smile?</p>

                <p>
                    In order for Amazon to donate to your charity, you have to
                    shop through the AmazonSmile website. Donate and Smile is a
                    browser extension that automatically redirects you to
                    AmazonSmile, so you don't have to remember to go to the
                    right website.

                <p class="question">How do I use Donate and Smile?</p>

                <p>
                    Now that you have installed the extension, you just need to
                    make sure that you have
                    <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/chpf/change" target="_blank">selected your charity</a>
                    on Amazon. The redirect will occur as long as you are
                    signed in on Amazon.

                    Use the checkbox on the <a id="preferences">preferences page</a>
                    or in the <span id="popup"><a>popup</a></span> that you can open with the
                    toolbar button. The button will be grey if the redirect is
                    off and orange if it is on.
